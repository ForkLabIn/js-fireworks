TODO



start from basics
- glyph object
  - single representation of vertices and drawing instructions
- draw outline of glyph
- firework object
- (spark object? extends firework)
- text object
  - made of glyphs, multiline











------------------------------------------


- we need all of cufon (to read the font, generate the vml) - but a fork
- getcoords: new method that gets the vertices of the glyphs
- drawglyph: show the glyph on the screen afterwards
- I wonder if we should break the glyph by closed path

1) x draw a glyph on the canvas

- most of cufon is about working out font/style options from the page
- generateFromVML will generate canvas commands from the glyph vml
- renderText is the loop that shows it
- we don't need cufon, just those functions


2) x draw the vertices on the canvas
3) rewrite the launcher to use 3d destinations
  ( this is just a bit of trig, not too hard )
4) switch to webgl
5) 3d explosions
6) sparkly afterglow
7) update the dialog, restore the sliders, etc.
8) add japanese, chinese, emoticons


bugs:
- resizer
- animationframe
- short url stuff
- kerning
